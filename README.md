# Web Simulation of UbuntuOS

This is a personal portfolio website themed after Ubuntu 20.04, made using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It simulates the Ubuntu operating system interface in a web environment.

If you want to edit this, clone this project and edit the files in `/src/components`.

To run this on localhost:
- Type `npm start` to start the development server.
- When you're done coding, type `npm run build` to build your app for production.

_NOTE: If you use Yarn, replace `npm start` and `npm run build` with `yarn start` and `yarn build`._
